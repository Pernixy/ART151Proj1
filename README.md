# ART151Proj

Wanted to create a "space" themed project. This project includes a 
planet/sun that can be controlled through the mouse input. 

The planet/sun is surrounded by stars that have varying patterns depending on whether the uesr hits the up or down arrow. 

The stars rotate around the object.
